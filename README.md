# simplicity-chess-engine
Simplicity is a chess engine which I have been working on and off since 2010. It is a Winboard engine which means it play other engines with software such as Arena.

It includes features such as: 
extensive use of both tables and bitboards

minimax alpha-beta search
pvs search
null move search

check evasion generation

razoring or frontier pruning

reductions
quiesence search
delta pruning
tapering
singular ply extensions

hash tables
pawn hash tables

a small internal opening book
some endgame knowledge
debug functions
ability to load positions

Note that it is a work in progress and there is more to be done.
